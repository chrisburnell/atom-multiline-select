# SlickEdit & CodeWright Style Column Select Package

This package borrows most of its functional code from the [Sublime Style Column Selection Package](https://atom.io/packages/sublime-style-column-selection).

In SlickEdit and formally CodeWright column selection is performed utilizing
just right mouse button and selecting the block of text desired.  The benefit of
this is that column select is no longer a two handed operation.
