# Atom Multiline Select

## Forked and Modified from [virtualthoughts](https://github.com/virtualthoughts)’s plugin, *[slickedit-select](https://github.com/virtualthoughts/slickedit-select)*.


Now uses the Left mouse button in combination with the ALT key, à la TextMate or Sublime Text.

Also added the CMD (meta) key to the ability to combine multiline selections (in addition to the existing CTRL key).
